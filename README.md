This is a complete example of the React Template video I made on Youtube,
I changed the colors a little so that they would both look good on light
and dark theme, and added minor changes.

Here is how to change the prefers-color-scheme in the developer tools:

1. Open it, CTR+SHIFT+i
2. Run Command to toggle from light-dark, CTR+SHIFT+P
3. Write prefers-color-scheme and change to the theme you wish to see:
